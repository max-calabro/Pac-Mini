## **_Getting Started_**

You play as Pac-Man and your goal is to eat all the dots without being caught by the ghosts! You can move Pac-Man with the arrow keys or w,a,s,d. Once all the dots are eaten you are a winner! But, if you are caught by the ghosts you lose a life. Lose three lives and its Game Over!
